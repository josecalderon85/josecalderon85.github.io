      <p> Welcome to my personal bio I hope you like it and get to know me a little bit more </p>

  <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p> I was born in Mexico City, and lived here until I was 14, then I moved to Texas where I lived for 15 years of my life.
         In Texas I started school and I was quickly introduced to football, I learned how to play it and since then developed a profound love for the game. I was an "All American Linebacker" In high school, I got offered a scholarship to go to college but I could not attend since I did not have the proper documentation.
          I started studying "Information Technology" at the local Community College while I was working at restaurants and doing odd jobs to make ends meet. I could not finish since I got in trouble with the law.
        Since 2 years ago I been back in Mexico City and I am trying to get something done with my life that is why I entered Hola Code.</p>
