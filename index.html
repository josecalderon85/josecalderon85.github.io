      <p>"All of us will face challenges in our life. Some are physical. Some are mental. Some are emotional. And each will demand a different strength to overcome them. There will be setbacks. There will be defeats. Move only forward. Persevere. Strong has many forms, find yours"</p>

      <p> Welcome to my personal bio I hope you like it and get to know me a little bit more </p>
<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> I was born in Mexico City, and lived here until I was 14, then I moved to Texas where I lived for 15 years of my life.
         In Texas I started school and I was quickly introduced to football, I learned how to play it and since then developed a profound love for the game. I was an "All American Linebacker" In high school, I got offered a scholarship to go to college but I could not attend since I did not have the proper documentation.
          I started studying "Information Technology" at the local Community College while I was working at restaurants and doing odd jobs to make ends meet. I could not finish since I got in trouble with the law.
        Since 2 years ago I been back in Mexico City and I am trying to get something done with my life that is why I entered Hola Code.</p>

        <p>This is where I got all of the knowledge about hardware I have, I was also on the poetry and History clubs.</p>
<h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p> On this section I would like to describe what my hobbies are and what do I like to do on my spare time.
     I enjoy lifting weights,Right now I am focused on becoming a strong man and maybe compete at a professional level, but really I need more time and money to accomplish this goal.
      I also enjoy watching and playing sports, like I mentioned on my intro football was a big influence growing up on the states.I played for a High School where the level was pretty high and I became pretty good, sadly I could not accomplish my dream of playing at a collegiate level.
       I also played a lot of basketball maybe you have seen me walking and see how I limp a little as I walk, well that is because I messed up one of my knees while playing ball.
     Another thing that passions me is Technology, I have always been a tech nerd who likes to have the latest gadgets.
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p> At this moment in my life I feel like I have not accomplish a lot of goals or dreams that I had set, that is why I enrolled into this program just to show myself that I am capable of accomplishing a goal. Like a mentioned before Technology has always passioned me and this program would really help me accomplish a short term goal I have.
